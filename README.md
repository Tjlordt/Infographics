# Infographics

This code generates an infographic that displays the trend of climate renewable energy consumption and fraction in the UK from 1990 to 2020. The infographic consists of seven subplots arranged in a grid using matplotlib's GridSpec module. There are 6 graphs (or plots) in the code. The 6 graphs are created using a combination of different types of plots such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms
The code also uses multiple Python libraries, including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy, for data analysis and visualization. Matplotlib's GridSpec module is used to create a customized grid layout for the subplots in the infographic, allowing for more control over their positioning and sizing. GridSpec is used to create a 3x3 grid layout for the different sections of the infographic, resulting in properly aligned and sized subplots and a professional-looking infographic.
The first subplot in the top-left shows the yearly energy consumption from primary fuels and renewable sources, with the data plotted as line charts. The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the energy consumption in million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe). The two lines, colored blue and orange, represent renewable and waste energy and primary fuels and equivalents, respectively.
The top-right subplot displays the fraction of renewable energy in the total energy consumption. The fraction is plotted as a line chart, and the x and y-axes represent the years and fraction (no units), respectively.
The middle-left subplot displays the renewable energy consumption over the years. The renewable energy consumption is plotted as a bar chart, with the x-axis representing the years and the y-axis representing the energy consumption in million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe). The bars are colored green.
The middle-right subplot displays the fraction of renewable energy over the years. The fraction is plotted as a line chart, with the x and y-axes representing the years and fraction (no units), respectively. The line is colored blue.
The bottom-left subplot displays the frequency of different renewable energy fractions. The fraction is plotted as a histogram, with the x-axis representing the fraction and the y-axis representing the frequency. The bars are colored orange.
The bottom-right subplot displays the relationship between the total energy consumption and the renewable energy fraction. The renewable energy fraction is plotted on the y-axis, and the total energy consumption is plotted on the x-axis. The data points are represented as a scatter plot, and the points are colored purple.
Finally, a text annotation is added in the last subplot at the bottom of the infographic. The annotation provides a brief description of the infographic's contents and purpose.
Overall, this infographic is well-designed and visually appealing. The color palette is easy on the eyes and effectively differentiates the different types of data. The use of multiple subplots allows the viewer to compare different aspects of the data easily. The addition of the text annotation provides context and makes the infographic more informative. The infographic provides a quick and easy-to-understand overview of the data, allowing viewers to see the changes in energy consumption and renewable energy fraction over time. It can be useful for individuals or organizations interested in the UK's energy consumption trends and policies related to renewable energy. The infographic can also serve as an educational tool for students or individuals interested in renewable energy and environmental issues. Regarding the analysis, the data presented in the infographic shows that the UK's renewable energy consumption has steadily increased from 1990 to 2020, while the fraction of renewable energy in the total energy consumption has also increased but at a slower rate. This suggests that the UK has made progress towards its climate goals but still has a long way to go to achieve a more sustainable energy mix.
